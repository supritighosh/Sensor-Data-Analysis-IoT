### Sensor Data Analysis for IoT

The IoT project work mainly consists of three components and they are-
- Data Collection
- Data Plotting
- Data Analysis 

#### IoT Equipments for Data Collection:

- **ESP32** - ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.
- **DHT11** - The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.
- **Raspberry Pi 4** - Raspberry Pi 4 has up to 8GB RAM, a faster quad-core CPU, support for dual displays at up to 4K resolution, Gigabit Ethernet, USB3.0, wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and USB-C power.
- **Breadboard** - Breadboard is a solderless device for temporary prototype with electronics and test circuit designs. Most electronic components in electronic circuits can be linked by slipping their leads or terminals into the holes and connecting them with wires where necessary.

#### Tools used:

- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

#### Libraries used:

- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn
- Stats Models

#### Project Details:

The project has three parts and the details of every part have been included [here](https://github.com/supritighosh/Sensor-Data-Analysis-IoT/blob/master/Project%20Report/IoT_Project_Report.pdf).
